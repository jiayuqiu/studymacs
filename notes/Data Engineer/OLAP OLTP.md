| **Purpose**          | Data analysis and decision support                      | Transaction processing                                       |
| **Data Volume**      | Large, historical data                                  | Current, real-time data                                      |
| **Query Complexity** | Complex queries (aggregations, calculations)            | Simple queries (inserts, updates, deletes)                   |
| **Response Time**    | Longer, can tolerate delays for complex queries         | Very fast, optimized for quick transactions                  |
| **Schema Design**    | Denormalized (star/snowflake schema)                    | Highly normalized                                            |
| **Examples**         | Sales analysis, financial reporting, marketing analysis | Banking transactions, e-commerce orders, reservation systems |

### Conclusion

OLAP and OLTP systems serve different needs within an organization. OLAP is used for analytical purposes, providing insights from large volumes of data, while OLTP is used for managing day-to-day transactional data with high efficiency and reliability. Understanding the differences between these systems helps organizations design their data architecture to meet both operational and analytical needs effectively.
